Looking for a roommate! 5min walk to BCIT. 5min walk to deer lake lark trails. 15min walk to metro town skytrain. 15min bus to brentwood skytrain

I'm renting the larger of two bedrooms in the basement suite I occupy. It has a very big closet, big window and is big enough for Queen size bed plus big desk plus extra space. It is unfurnished. $650 + 1/2 utilities (basement pays 30% of utilities from whole house... You pay half of the 30%)

The suite is a ground level basement and gets lots of light from sliding glass doors in living room and big windows. It is an older house and not in the best shape, but I have made the suite lovely and it feels like a sweet sanctuary. It is all carpeted and I have a good vacuum in the house. 

Kitchen is narrow but lots of counter space. I eat 95% vegan but am fine with other people eating whatever their choices are. 

Bathroom is Tiny and standing shower only.

Huge backyard with permission to garden as desired. I have ripped up a lot of the grass to put in some garden space already, but lots more available if interested. Good for lying around in the yard. 

I am 36. Female. I have a male cat 

I love people and love to feel community with them, but do also spend a lot of my time at home quiet and inward. While at home, I will be mostly meditating, studying, cooking, gardening or sitting on the back porch looking at the garden. I also like the occasional movies (:

Media in bedrooms needs to be quiet or with earbuds. Media in common spaces with check-in when others are around.

I'm sober and want the home to be sober. No drugs, alcohol or weed please. Smokers need to go for a walk outside.

I am starting full time school for degree in social work in September. Also working part-time.

I'm in my late twenties, have a stable job, and am quiet, clean, responsible, and mature. My cat is completely hairless so he's hypoallergenic, and also stays indoors. Willing to pay a pet deposit as well as a damage deposit. I can move in anytime between now and September 1st (I've been subletting and the woman is moving back in so I need to move). I would love to find something longterm. I love gardening so if that's something you want me to do for your property I'm more than happy!

I need a studio or one-bedroom apartment (no roommate situations please). Access to laundry preferred. $1100 or less. I work at 6am on Hastings and Victoria so somewhere along Hastings or Victoria would be perfect, but open to other areas if transit is available. 

If you have something like this available please get in touch! Thank you :)    "

I am a 30 year old female looking for another female roommate to share a 2 bedroom suite with. I am a working professional and enjoy being active, so I am not home that often. 
I have a private furnished room (includes bed and dresser) available for 4 months (September to December). The rent includes internet and access to laundry  (I have my own washer and dryer) and access to the kitchen, and living room area. I have two bathrooms in my suite and one will be practically yours but is also there for guest use

My place is a 5-10 minute bus ride to either Edmonds, New West, or 22nd street station with all stops going in all directions at the foot of the entrance. This is perfect for a student attending Douglas College or someone who has just moved to Canada and needs a temporary home

*required* $900 a month, $450 damage deposit. Hydro is extra on a 50/50 basis and usually ends up costing on average $12-$15 a month per person (the bill cycle runs two months at a time). References may be needed. Non-smoking, and no loud parties.  Please message me if you're interested. Available Sept 1st.    "

This ad is VERY misleading. It says washer and dryer in unit but it is in upstairs peoples unit and he does not tell you that it's coin laundry. 
In his ad and on the phone he says $1400 utilities included but is actually charging an ADDITIONAL $100 for utilities. He springs it on you at the place and says ""oh I told you it's $1500 with utilities right?"" No, in his ad and on the phone he said $1400 with utilities included. 
So not only will you have to pay an extra $100 more than he and his ad initially say, you will also have to pay for coin laundry on top of paying for the water and electricity that run the washer and dryer. 

I understand it is a relatively good price but people need to be upfront about the type of property they are renting out. I have lost interest in renting this suite due to the lack of transparency and honesty from the landlord. I just wanted to give others a heads up before they go look at it that the ad is not 100% honest.    "

Hi, my name is Martin, 

I am a private rental agent who has the knowledge and the expertise to maneuver your application through a successful rental. I own two properties myself, so I know and understand how to best approach and speak with landlords to make your application standout, with the added benefits of screening the landlord, avoiding scams, negotiating the rent, and terms of the rental, such as pets allowance, furnishings, move in date etc.

When competing for lower valued rentals ($1000 to $2500 range) you are going up against tens, if not hundreds of applications and competing with other potential tenants. It's time consuming and I know the feeling of disappointment when you submit your application and get a call, if they even take the time to contact you, to let you know that the property is rented out. You didn't even stand a chance, so why did they invite you to look. I am able to position your application in a way landlords will give you the top priority and landlords generally love to deal with a tenant who is represented professionally by a rental agent, because they trust that we screen our clients and provide a higher standard. 

As such, when requested, you will need to provide all the usual information the landlord will be requesting for me to able to satisfy their selection process. 

My fee ranges from $500 to $1500 for finding you a rental property depending on the complexity of the project.

If you are interested you can call or text me  show contact info


My focus areas are primarily North Vancouver and West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver.

Some of my finds include: A house with the perfect backyard for a family that were looking to open a daycare. I've worked with location scouting for films and movies, I've found short term rentals for tourists and visitors that saved them thousands from the hotel fees, and I've found students room and boards and rentals close to universities. My most recent find was for a lawyer who was looking for the perfect home office, and a young couple who were moving out for the first time on their own to start their journey in life. I've also assisted with relocation of employees for several companies. 

Thanks for reading.

We are a couple renting one bedroom of our 2-bedroom apartment. It has as amazing view and the location is pretty convenient since you will have easy access to New West skytrain and shopping. For us, it is really important to keep our home clean and tidy so we expect someone as organized as we are. We are looking for a young professional or student with mature and respective personalities. We are in our mid 20s and we are most of the time at work so prefer to share our home with someone who is in a similar situation. We barely bring people home so we expect you don’t bring all of your friends all the time, specially week-days. Even though it is month to month rent you still have to pay deposit and if you want to move you would have to let us know with a prior month so we can find someone else. 

*Great location easy access to bus/skytrain & shopping 

*Available Sept 1

*Pay rent on time 

*Month to Month rental plus security deposit 

*Room is unfurnished (can be furnished if needed)

*Includes utilities & wifi

*in-suite laundry 

*Gym/steam room 

* Great for Douglas Students since it is five minutes away walking 

*No parking 

*NO smoking (no cigarettes, cigars, marihuana)

*NO parties 

*NO pets 

*Occasional friends coming over is ok but not all the time 

*Clean after yourself  (you will be expected to keep your room / washroom clean and tidy up after yourself around the rest of the house)

*We are ok with couples. Rent for single person is $1000 and for couple $1300 (utilities and wifi included)

If you are interested you can send us an email telling us a bit about you.

Thank you !!

I have strong references and am looking for a long term rental. I want to be no further east than Abbotsford. I work from home and my pug is well behaved too. I need 1 bedrooms, the max I will pay is $770 including internet and TV and utilities and needs to have a shared washing machine at least. It must be self contained except for the washing machine. It needs to be a fenced back yard that my suite opens onto as well. I should add since I get quite a few people emailing me saying that this price is impossible. I have found that there are some vacancies that are east of Abbotsford for $770 all in.    "

Hi, my name is Kevin,

I am a private individual who has the knowledge and the expertise to maneuver student applications through a successful rental. I own two properties myself, so I know how to best approach and speak with landlords to make your application standout, with the added benefits of screening the landlord, avoiding scams, and negotiating the rent, and terms of rental, such as pets allowance, furnishings etc. 

When competing for lower valued rentals ($1000 to $2500 range) you are going up against tens, if not hundreds of applications and competing potential tenants. It's time consuming and I know the feeling of disappointment when you submit your application and get a call to update you that the property is rented out. You didn't even stand a chance, so why did they invite you to look. I am able to position your application in a way landlords will give top priority and landlords generally love to deal with a private agent, because they trust that we screen our clients and have the knowledge how to pick. It’s like finding a perfect match, but instead of Tinder, using Match.com ... I hope you enjoyed the laugh. 

As such, when requested, you will need to provide all the usual information the landlord will be requesting for me to able to satisfy their selection process. 

My fee ranges from $500 to $1500 for finding you a rental property depending on the complexity of the project, paid when you are successfully chosen as a candidate by the landlord. 

You can call or text me: 604-417-81487

My focus areas are primarily Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminister 

I have helped over 200 students find the perfect rental and i'm positive can help you too.

Thanks for reading.

Kevin    "

Finding a quality homestay can be difficult.  Most agencies push low-quality housing with tiny, dark rooms, strange rules and awful food.  This can be especially hard for younger students, alone in a new country with limited emotional support.

I offer a family home with spacious rooms, great food, no silly rules, full laundry service, homework help and a supportive host family.

We have 3 small kids, aged 6, 5 and 5 months.  They are well-behaved kids who love having “older brothers and sisters” to play with.  We also have two very small dogs who stay only on one floor.  The language of the house in English.

The house is a huge North Burnaby mansion.  We have 9 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, 4 living rooms, a huge backyard, TV room with big screen and Netlfix, smart home devices and more.

We specialize in caring for students under 21.  We have an 8 month minimum stay.  Guardianship is included in the price.  

With 15 years experience working with international students, we are excellent at understanding the needs of our guests.  I have owned and operated English schools in North America and Asia, run a student agency and I currently manage a network of homestay families around the Vancouver area that similarly specialize in the care of younger students.  If you need housing in Kitsilano, Kerrisdale, South Burnaby, North Burnaby, North Vancouver or elsewhere, please let me know and I will help find you the best, most caring spaces and hosts.

So you've decided to send your child abroad to get a Canadian education at high school or university.  Great!  This is a beautiful country with a solid educational system and international prestige.

After spending tens of thousands on private schools back home, plane tickets, and tuition at a Canadian school, do you really want to go cheap and save a few hundred a month on the home your child will be starting each day at?

Without a supportive home environment with good people, healthy food, and minimal stress, how can a young international student succeed academically, socially, or emotionally away from all their support systems?

I've been working with international students for 16 years.  I've owned schools and agencies on two continents and have worked almost exclusively with kids (under 20 years old) for most of that time.  I now operate a small network of homestay hosts (in addition to my own home) who specialize in the *proper* care of minors.

The photos below are of my home in North Burnaby, a 9-bedroom, 6-bathroom family home for myself, my partner, and our 3 daughters (aged 6, 5 and 4 months).  We share our home with high school and university students from around the world.  They eat what we eat, they have large bright rooms, they have their laundry done for them, they get homework help when they need it, we counsel them and make sure they are emotionally stable in a foreign land.  We give them love because kids need people who care about them to be successful.  We are close to SFU, FIC, Burnaby North, Burnaby Mountain, Alpha Secondary, Moscrop, BCIT and more.

Our partner homes in Vancouver, Burnaby and North Vancouver care about the same things we do.

Our home has been called ""The best homestay I've ever seen"" by several agents.  I aim to live up to that praise.

We currently have 4 rooms available for September.  2 rooms are pending a deposit but are still available as of today (Aug 7th).

Prices are all-inclusive and even include custodianship where needed.

Hi, my name is Martin, 

I am a private rental agent who has the knowledge and the expertise to maneuver your application through a successful rental. I own two properties myself, so I know and understand how to best approach and speak with landlords to make your application standout, with the added benefits of screening the landlord, avoiding scams, negotiating the rent, and terms of the rental, such as pets allowance, furnishings, move in date etc.

When competing for lower valued rentals ($1000 to $2500 range) you are going up against tens, if not hundreds of applications and competing with other potential tenants. It's time consuming and I know the feeling of disappointment when you submit your application and get a call, if they even take the time to contact you, to let you know that the property is rented out. You didn't even stand a chance, so why did they invite you to look. I am able to position your application in a way landlords will give you the top priority and landlords generally love to deal with a tenant who is represented professionally by a rental agent, because they trust that we screen our clients and provide a higher standard. 

As such, when requested, you will need to provide all the usual information the landlord will be requesting for me to able to satisfy their selection process. 

My fee ranges from $500 to $1500 for finding you a rental property depending on the complexity of the project.

If you are interested you can call or text me  show contact info


My focus areas are primarily North Vancouver and West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver.

Some of my finds include: A house with the perfect backyard for a family that were looking to open a daycare. I've worked with location scouting for films and movies, I've found short term rentals for tourists and visitors that saved them thousands from the hotel fees, and I've found students room and boards and rentals close to universities. My most recent find was for a lawyer who was looking for the perfect home office, and a young couple who were moving out for the first time on their own to start their journey in life. I've also assisted with relocation of employees for several companies. 

Thanks for reading.

Hello all,

My name is Victoria and i am relocating from Alberta as i will be attending school in Vancouver for one year and have been having a difficult time finding a pet friendly unit. 

a bit about myself.. I am 29 years old, a mother of one ( 9 year old) and have (1) one 12 week old puppy (she will be around 50 lbs full grown)

i will be attending school Monday to Wednesday at which time puppy will be in doggy daycare. 

my budget depends of what is all included in rent although i would like to keep it modest and reasonable (1600/mnth MAX.)

I would prefer a 2 bedroom or 1 bedroom plus den, Although i am open to a studio (as my daughter will be staying in Alberta with her father during my studies)

Ideally, it would be near transit or sky-train station. I am open to downtown, east, south or north Vancouver areas, as well as Burnaby, or New Westminster areas. 

I'm very quite, non smoker, don't party and take good care of my space. I have amazing past rental references as well. I'm open to renting from a small family or couple or even room & boarding, so long as my fur baby is welcome too.


Please contact me at  show contact info
 via text or email me if you have a pet friendly unit. I will be in Vancouver as of august 15, at which time i will be able to meet and view units. i'm looking to secure something for Sept 1st or 15th.

Victoria.    "

Hi there. I want to rent out my 1 private bedroom( with a queen size bed ). I live in a 2 bedrooms condo with amazing view in a high-raise building. I love to keep my home clean and tidy, and I rarely cook at home. I'm looking for a young professional with mature and respective personalities.
I'm in my late 20s and I work a lot so prefer to share my home with someone who is in a similar situation. Prefer females. No smoking, no party and no pet plz. 

Rent includes gas, hot water,  no parking. You will have your own private bathroom. I live in the master room so we don't need to share the bathroom. 
If you are interested, plz send me some information about you.

Looking for ONE responsible, clean and friendly female roommate to share a large, beautiful and spacious brand-new house with six other girls. Roommates are in their mid-twenties and working full-time/students so we are looking for someone who will be quiet/keep to themselves/be respectful of the house environment and will fit in with the other girls. The house is very clean and quiet most of the time because the bedrooms are divided over three floors. Each girl has her own private bathroom so no sharing necessary. There is a cleaning schedule that all the roommates take part in to divide chores/keep the common areas clean. 

NO smoking/vaping. NO pets. For the safety and comfort of all roommates, there is a NO overnight guests policy (you will have to make accommodations for visiting friends and family elsewhere; they cannot sleep overnight in the home). 

All utilities except cable included. Six months is preferred. 

Common areas are furnished. The bedroom is also furnished (large carpet, bed, side table and dresser). It is the master bedroom of the house and has its own heat control, large walk-in closet, and bathroom. The bathroom is equipped with a large shower, jacuzzi, two sinks and toilet. 

Laundry on site. Lots of parking if you drive. Bus stops to two different routes are right by the house and are mere minutes away from three different skytrain stations. 

The house is located in the Metrotown area, in a safe, quiet, and clean residential neighbourhood. It is within 5-10 minutes walking distance to local grocery stores, medical services, gas station, etc.

If you are interested, have any questions or want to set up a viewing time, email or text/call  show contact info
 and tell us a bit about yourself. Are you working? Studying? What is a typical day/routine for you? Do you have guests over often? Do you cook? Please do not simply send us your email addresses or contact information. We will only reach out to those who have taken the time to read the entire ad.

Available starting Aug. 15, we're looking for a tenant(s) interested in short term (minimum 3-6 months) rental tenancy with possible term renewals for our master bedroom in our 2 bedroom condo (931 sq ft). The other bedroom is already currently rented by another tenant so the kitchen, dining area, living room, and in-suite laundry will be shared spaces. Each bedroom is private with their own bathroom and walk-in closet. Master bedroom is furnished with a large queen bed, table, office chair, and lamps. The shared kitchen, dining area, and living room are furnished too. Monthly hydro utilities (electricity & water), Shaw 300 internet, and 1 reserved underground parking spot are included in the monthly rent. Tenants also have full access to the condo's amenities (gym, hot tub, & rec/meeting room). Great for a tenant(s) who is looking to just move in quickly as everything is provided!

Our condo is high up on the 16th floor of the Fitzgerald building with breathtaking scenes of panoramic southern, western and northern views of Burnaby, the downtown Vancouver city lights, and snow capped North Shore Mountains! The Brentwood location is stunning too as it's a 20 minute drive to downtown Vancouver, walking distance from the Brentwood Town Centre mall, skytrain, bus stops, grocery stores (Save On Foods & Whole Foods), and lots of restaurants/cafes.

Rent is $1600 per month. Please email me if interested or have any questions, thanks!    "

*If this ad is up, the space is still available. No pets. Street parking.

$720 - All inclusive rent. 1 medium sized, unfurnished room available in a 2 bdr suite for Sep 01, 2019. Laundry available on site.
$360 damage deposit.

Location: G/F suite is located in between Joyce & Patterson skytrain. Very close to BCIT! Nearest supermarkets at Crystal Mall, Metrotown & Kingsway. 
Buses & skytrain close by. 

The place:
This home is intended for quiet, peaceful living, working & relaxing. It's not a party house, guests welcome in good judgment and moderation. The kitchen/living room is already setup, so the space is best suited for someone who doesn't have a lot of home items. No storage area. Shared bathroom with bathtub. Space is for one person (no couples) and myself. 

What I'm looking for:
Looking for someone who is an energetic compliment to the space, someone who has a full-time job or studying, who is calm and understands the importance of quiet/down-time but also knows how to enjoy their life. Someone who is flexible, well-mannered and understanding. Ideally someone who works in film or who understands someone who works in the industry. Someone CLEAN, considerate and respectful, an adult and knows how to clean up after themselves in a communal space. If you drink occasionally, that's fine but no heavy drinkers. Looking for someone who agrees to a one month trial period but is looking for a long-term arrangement. Someone who is comfortable following a bi-weekly cleaning schedule to keep things in order. Someone between the ages of 30-45, if you're younger feel free to contact. Someone who can respect quiet time after 11pm on weekdays. Someone mature, with life experience, who knows how to communicate well in general, and, in times of potential difficulty. Someone who can create a space of balance, harmony and open communication with me.

About me:
I'm 34 year old woman who works in the film & tv industry. My schedule is never the same during the week, and, I work long hours. I consistently work Sunday evenings. I'm usually in bed by a decent hour as sleep & resting is important. I enjoy different kinds of electronic music, so, the person I live with would need to be comfortable with that from time-to-time. I'm clean and would love to live with someone who integrates cleanliness as a discipline.

If interested please reply by email and answer the following questions. I will respond to those who sound like a good match!

1. Age, sex, profession & your working schedule
2. Your intended duration of rental
3. Your phone number
4. Your current situation/ a brief description about yourself or anything you'd like to share    "

THE PLACE:

You will share the 3-bed upper floor of a character house,with your comfortable, private bedroom and share a bathroom, kitchen, dining room, lounge and large yard (front and back.) There are 2 of you upstairs and I live downstairs. I share the kitchen and common areas as needed, but very rarely. 

A really great opportunity for the right person:. Introvert heaven? Or a great home base for your world of adventure? A peaceful place to study, read, write, draw...?  It is an older house in a quiet, private neighbourhood and it has character-wooden-walls and flooring and is clean and in good shape. I care about my home. 

You will be able to enjoy a private room in a lovely green setting, access to the spacious, peaceful 3-bedroom upstairs of this characterful house, one primary neighbour upstairs, your landlord (me) downstairs (much of the time), access to on-site laundry downstairs and street parking. 

I keep a safe, quiet, comfortable home and live a decent life. I'm kind to the people who help me do this!

ME:
I'm an honest, friendly, sociable, artistic, intelligent, mature male. I am totally positive re. cool, eccentric, nerdy, straight, gay, trans, old, young, large, small...  all low-key, good, honest people are welcome.

- Mature, quiet, peaceful people are most welcome. NO hard-drugs or heavy drinkers. 420 ok outside.
- Employed/financially secure (and can prove it, and always, always pay the rent on time)
- Mellow, respectful, clean, honest. No angry bigots in my home, thank you! 
- You and your stuff are guaranteed clean and bed bug/cockroach free. I've never seen either in my home and never want to!
- You gave great references.

THE BASIC RULES:
- Pay the rent in full before the start of each month (i.e. the last day of the previous month). 
- Pay 50% damage deposit to secure the place, and pay rent in full before moving in. 
 when you agree to rent, plus 1 full months' rent before moving in.
- No smoking in the house. No cigarette smoking is ideal. Outside if you must. 
- No hard drugs or heavy drinkers. Marijuana is ok, but smoking outside and not around sensitive guests. 
- No couples. Quiet overnight guests a couple of nights per week,but not living with you. Your guests will never be alone in the house and you will be responsible for them.  
- No bringing home strangers from the bar or anywhere else. Respectful, trustworthy, quiet, modest tenants and visitors only! We value the security of our home! 
- Clean up after yourself promptly (especially in the kitchen and bathroom.)
- Do not touch anyone else's stuff ever.
- Must work or study full-time and have a secure income. 

Please e-mail me. and let me know why you'd be a great fit here. 
Thanks to everyone who contacts me for their time and interest.

Tired of basement apartments in noisy and polluted neighbourhoods? Then move in next to Confederation Park, a huge green space with lots of sun and shade, quiet and vibrant corners, public BBQs, tracks, tennis/basketball/football courts, public library, indoor swimming pool, etc..

A 95 B-Line bus stop (connecting SFU on Burnaby mountain to downtown) is within short walking distance. The vibrant Hastings street with lots of restaurants, grocery stores, etc is also within walking distance. 

Enjoy your breakfast, dinner and beer in our small garden, which feels like a private extension of the park. You won't be bothered by any traffic or noise whatsoever. The apartment itself is a garden suite (all above ground level) with a very bright kitchen and living room. Your BR (15 sqm = 161 sqft) will be the larger one of two BRs. We share a small but nice bathroom. There is a dead end hallway, which allows for lot's of storage space for sports equipment etc. Washer and dryer are in the garage with direct access from our apartment. The garage also allows for bike storage, but not much more than that. 

I am a German PhD student (27M yrs old) looking forward to a shared living space in which we respect each other and each other's needs. I am happy to be social, but I also have a lot going on and enjoy time for myself. When there is some free time, I play in the outdoors. 
Small dogs are potentially ok (I don't have any - but my friends will bring some over every now and then). You can have my king size bed (photo) if you want. We can also rearrange the shared space if you have other ideas and needs.
An individual will pay 1050$ plus share of bills (annual average about 150$ for whole apartment), a couple 1250$ plus shares of bills. Move in preferably in August, beginning of September is also ok.

Please write me an email with a little about yourself and how you picture us living together. Looking forward to you! Flo    "

I am taking one of the two bedrooms, and looking for a someone to rent the other room furnished with a single bed that is available as of September 1st. In addition, there is a full size dinner table, big sofa and coffee table in the common area. Rent includes private bathroom, on-site gym facilities, in-suite washer and dryer, dishwasher and gas range stove. 

Rent is $1000 per month including utilities (+ 1/2 internet). Damage deposit of $500 is required. The rental contract is with the homeowner and requires a 1 year (12 months) agreement. Parking stall available for extra cost ($75/month). The homeowner regularly checks on the place but will give necessary notice. This is not a month-to-month rental. If you reply, please understand that.

I am a 22 year-old guy who is quiet, respectful, responsible and clean/organized currently starting my 4th year and originally from Chilliwack, BC. The homeowner posts a cleaning schedule at least a month in advance - pretty much both roommates are responsible in alternate weeks for cleaning the common areas. It is important to me that you have a good personality and open communication (ability to bring up issues and responding to text messages). I am really friendly and like to get to know new people. I prefer that you have experience renting elsewhere and don't feel uncomfortable living with new people. 

If you are interested, shoot me a message with a little about yourself.    "

Bright and spacious ground level suite with separate entry.   We have just replaced the flooring in the main living area with a high quality vinyl laminate so bear with us as the baseboards aren’t in yet! This suite remains cool in the summer months with lots of light and is cozy in the winter.  

There is a gated, very secure cement area where the main entrance is (around back) where you are welcome to put a small table and chairs if you wish.   

Great for a working professional or student.

We do have children who use the outside space so please keep that in mind 🤗

**Please only text me about this posting as I can answer texts at work
*if its still up here its available 

2 Bedrooms available in 3 bed room place close to SFU. 


Students are preferred but its not necessary


LGBTQ friendly 


My long time roommate is moving out and I’d like to rent out the two rooms he had.


650 for master bedroom and 600 for regular bedroom. 


Im only looking to have 2 other people move into this space, couples are welcome but we have to split the rent 3 ways.


We split internet and hydro

**Almost all of the furniture will be going besides The TV, its stand, one couch and the kitchen table so please bring some stuff if you want and I'm open to getting new things if you don't like the current ones. 
I’ll be buying furniture if no one else brings any, but not for a while.

1 bathroom

Spacious living room with kitchen attached 

Dining area, balcony and lots of closet space , ( 3 closets in the hall, one walk-in storage room, ALSO a closet in every room. ) 


I’m aiming to rent the spaces to people who share similar living values. I just think it would be nice to feel as comfortable as possible living with other new people.

The main values I have about the space I live in and people I live with are for the common areas to be tidy, there to be a quiet time after a certain hour, also Saturday mornings ( I work very late ) and everyone to talk about things that bug them, with calm assertiveness. 


* all of this is up for discussion if you feel like you want to add or change anything.


Tidy: 

The resting state (ie when its not being used) of counter tops, coffee tables and any table should be clear. The floor of the kitchen be swept every few days, 2 to 3, and we can share vacuuming the living room and hall once a week ( takes about 15mins to do ).


Take out the garbage / recycling weekly and if anyone is going to be drinking alcohol they can keep the empties on the balcony in a special box, I don’t really drink often ( a glass of scotch or a beer on the weekend. ) 


Quiet time: after 10 or 11pm ( what ever we agree on taking everyones schedule into account )  


Most Fridays I’m at work till 3 or 6 am so I need to sleep in on Saturdays. 


Talking about stuff: 

Living with people you don’t know very well yet can be challenging sometimes.  I just need to know that if you have something that makes you feel uncomfortable, you’ll bring it up within 1 to 3 days at most, that same day is best, if people have the energy to hear it. ￼

If talking about your feelings is something brand new to you, this living situation might not be the best option, unless you have confidence you can do it.

I can show you the place on the weekend just give me notice and we can arrange a time for you to come by. 
I have one random day off during the week also.

Please only text me about this posting

Thank you    "

Hi. My names AJ. I'm moving up to Burnaby in September (or late August) to begin a masters program at SFU. I'm a US citizen and live in Washington state (about 6 hours from Burnaby). I have hardly even left the state, let alone the country, and the transition I'm most worried about is finding a place to stay when I arrive. 

- Moving to Burnaby sometime next month (August) or September 1st at latest
- Biology MS/PhD student. 29 years old. 
- I have a DOG. She is small (a shitzu mutt), adorable, and very friendly. Potty trained. Hoping to find a dog-friendly home where she won't be lonely while I'm working or at class. I'm a huge animal lover in general. 
- I have 10k saved up and will be working in a lab. Also parents can spot me. So I'll never be late with rent. 
- Hoping to pay less than ~800 a month. 
- Prefer to have roommates around my age who aren't totally anti-social, and don't mind occasionally having some drinks and socializing. As someone moving to a completely new city I'd like to meet some people!
- Need to be near SFU. 20 minute drive at most. 
- I'm very easy going and never get angry or annoyed. Since I live far away we can't meet in person, but I suggest you surf through my facebook and see I'm not a weirdo - https://www.facebook.com/aj.keefe.5 
- I lived in Bellingham for 6 years working on my BS in psych at Western Washington University, and have had many many roommates (probably about 15-20). So I know the drill. 
- I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink socially but not too often.  

Please let me know! Hoping to sort this housing situation out ASAP to lessen the stress of moving to a new country

- AJ    "

1248,Trying to Find a New Space For October or Later,N/A,Aug  2,https://vancouver.craigslist.org/bnc/sha/d/trying-to-find-new-space-for-october-or/6947667838.html,0,,,"

QR Code Link to This Post


Hey everyone,  
My name's Nathan, and I'll be looking to move into a new space no sooner than October 1st. I'm in a very relaxed place at the moment, so I can take my time to find the perfect spot. So I may be trawling through here and the various other Vancouver rental groups for a while, until I find a place that feels right, and fits my needs.

A bit about me:  
I'm a 6'6"" tall, abled, cis, white male, but I’m open and accepting towards LGBTQ+. I'm very liberal. Pro-choice, anti-wage-gap, anti-trump, pro-immigrant, feminist, etc.

I recently got turned onto a healthier lifestyle (Thanks dad!), and have cut out almost all processed and fast food. I've begun to exercise far more often, and consistently, than I have before. I'm on week three, and have lost almost 10 Lbs! Not that I especially needed to, but I was slightly overweight and had a horrible diet.  

Something I should also mention is that I'm on the autism spectrum, but am high-functioning (I hate that term, but it's the quickest way of describing my mental state). In short, that means I can mask very well for short durations, but it is very mentally draining. The more you get to know me the more you'll be able to see through it. My most obvious ""tells"" are staring longer than I realize, getting overwhelmed due to sensory overload, and a minor inability to parse subtle body- and facial-language.

These can lead to myriad issues. Social awkwardness due to staring, the tendency to clam up and shut down physically when I've become overwhelmed, and misunderstanding peoples’ intentions/desires/meanings due to bad body language translation, just to name a few of the more obvious ones.

Personality/Likes:
I'm a big ol' geek. I love gaming and tech, and my favorite video media to consume is animated movies and television. Think Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Bob's Burgers, Archer, Big Hero 6, Zootopia, etc.
Not a huge loud music fan (Refer to sensory overload above), so I very rarely go to parties or concerts. I'm quite the recluse, in fact. Very hermit-ish. I revel in my alone time. Though whether that's a part of my autistic tendencies, or just me being on the extreme end of introverted I cannot say.
I also love to read. I'll usually tear through a novel or three every month. Mostly Sci-fi and Fantasy.

I have a few hobbies on top of my general enjoyments. I'm a creative type, and love to work with my hands. Woodwork, metalwork, sewing, cooking, etc. What I'm fixated on at the moment is building custom PC cases, made with both metal and custom carved wood accents, with different fandoms as themes for different cases. 

As I mentioned, I love to cook, so joining a collective where we each make food contributions to the house would be very rewarding.

I also really love deep conversations and learning new things (I'm currently learning Spanish to prep for a trip to Spain July 2020). So if you like talking about important subjects, I'd love to participate. And please, let me know if I say anything insensitive. I may be very liberal, but I'm still a white, cis male, and it's an ongoing struggle to push back against my ingrained privilege.

What I'm looking for in a place:
Ideally, I want a place where I'd have a decent sized bedroom which can fit a queen bed, desk, chair, computer, multiple bookshelves, a dresser, and some open space for VR/stretching.

It would need to have some good, secure storage space so I can store all my tools and other possessions with peace of mind.

I would also need to be able to use power tools on the property. I'm working towards making my hobbies into a business, and I'd need to be able to carve wood and cut metal without bothering people too much. So that pretty much means a house with a yard and/or shed. This is why an apartment wouldn't work.

As for fellow room/housemates, as I said I'm open to all comers  As long as you're honest, relatively tidy, and respectful of me, my possessions, and my mental needs (needed alone time, etc.) then I'd love to have you as a housemate!

If you happen to be interested in videogames and/or animated media, and would like to game/watch together, that's a bonus!

Also working out. I'd love housemates that would come to the gym with me, or who would all go on big adventures out into the hiking trails around the cities, or go ride bikes through Stanley Park.

Anyways, my budget for rent is $1,000, though that's the maximum. I hope to find somewhere slightly less than that. Hope to talk to a few of you!

TL;DR: I think I'm pretty neat! I need space to use power tools. My budget for a place is $1,000.

P.S: I'm going to be posting this exact message in multiple areas, so don't be surprised to see this copied and pasted elsewhere.    "

Us
This one is important to us, we want to meet great people to join our 'Homies' not just to lay up in their rooms. We're active, organizing fun things each week to do together, movies, beach, events, TV and popcorn, board games nights, Playland, clubbing you get the idea. 
We are 25, 28, 30, two guys and a gal. All working professionals. Clean and tidy. We share chores and space, and help each other out whenever we can. We split internet 150. We like to keep the living room lively with movie nights, music, chatting, etc. There are two other guys living downstairs 22, 23 that come up all the time to hang out and join in. The house is always buzzing. If you want to join in, we want you here. 

We have 2 cats, one of which is very friendly and loves head scratches. The other is a lazy s.o.b. and just sleeps on my bed all day. She's pretty chill too. We're not sure about introducing yet another cat into the house, but if you're awesome and you come with a cat, we'd be happy to discuss. Sorry, no dogs, as per the lease.

We're hoping to add to the squad, with some awesome folks who want to keep the family vibe going.
If this is you, give us a shout and tell us a little about yourself.

Hey!

My name's Michael, I'm 23, and currently a student at Langara. 

I'm looking for a roommate to move in as soon as possible - even today!

The private room isn't furnished except it does have a new memory foam queen mattress. The room also has a projector screen (if you have a projector you can watch movies) and a walk-in closet. 

There is also one bathroom that we share. 

You're free to use the rice maker, blender, oven/stove, toaster oven, microwave, dishes, pots, pans etc whenever. Same for the vacuum. There's coin laundry/dryer in building (update - improved machines no longer require coins. Swipe a card to use machines for MUCH more convenience). 

The location is a 15 second walk to the convenience store & 30 second walk to the library. Is RIGHT outside the metrotown SkyTrain station (20 second walk). There's a couple basketball courts and tennis courts near by as well as the bonsor recreational center. There's a soccer and baseball field with in 6 minute walking distance. There's even a golf course close by!

Of course there is the metrotown mall, 2 or so minute walk away, so you can walk to the movie theatre or food court or super store, or any store for that matter in no time. There's an elevator in the building which is handy. 

My current roommate lived here for 8 months, but she headed out to live with her friends. 

Her loss and your gain! Did I mention this is a penthouse? 

Sure it's also a low rise apartment building, but hey, the funs all the same! 

$715 everything included (internet, hydro etc etc).

If the ad is up, the room is still available. 


If you're interested, email me and we'll set up an appointment. Sooner the better.

Warm regards,
Michael.    "

Non-partiers, non-smokers. We both are very busy with work so we are going to treat our place as a relaxing home and not a dorm...We have one older cat that is very well trained and quiet/shy. He will only go out when we are at home and during the day time. 

Hoping to have a place over 800 sq ft, (2 bedrooms or 1 bedroom one den) and a renovated/new kitchen with stainless steel appliances (we both love cooking and a nice kitchen is a must). I am happy to provide employer references/landlord references and a credit check. Also, I can provide a lot of pet references :)

I am looking for a female Indian roommate to share my one bedroom apartment in Burnaby near Patterson Skytrain station.

It's a spacious apartment where two people can fit in comfortably. The living room is completely empty - big enough to convert into a separate private room. This is a safe place with security token for building and lift access. The location is really convenient, as it's just a few steps away from Sky train station, Metro town mall,  Restaurants, Banks etc. Coin laundry is available in the building. 

I am quite, friendly and clean and would expect the same.

Hi, I'm looking for a friendly and responsible roommate to share my new apartment. You will get a private room and private bathroom in the 2 bed/2 bath home.

I am a young professional woman and just bought the apartment. I recently graduated from SFU and am looking for another student or professional to share the space with. Sorry, no couples and I would prefer to live with another woman.

The apartment is walking distance to SkyTrain, Douglas College, all shopping in downtown New West. It's also easy to get to SFU Surrey, SFU Burnaby, or the Coquitlam Douglas campus.

The common areas are furnished and I can make room for any pieces you would like to bring. You are welcome to use all of the furniture and household supplies, including the brand new barbeque!

The bedroom can be furnished or unfurnished - please let me know your preference in your reply.

There are lots of other great features:
-Secured underground parking
-Dog-friendly
-Storage locker
-Gym on sight
-Utilities included (internet, but no cable)
-In-suite laundry
-Dishwasher
-Vaulted ceilings
-River view

Please reply with a bit about yourself and what you are looking for in a room mate. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about me!

I like to relax at home and mostly just cook, take care of my plants, do yoga, go down to the gym, and watch Netflix. I'm quite busy and am only home a few nights per week.

Hi. My names AJ. I'm moving up to Burnaby in September (or late August) to begin a masters program at SFU. I'm a US citizen and live in Washington state (about 6 hours from Burnaby). I have hardly even left the state, let alone the country, and the transition I'm most worried about is finding a place to stay when I arrive. 

- Moving to Burnaby sometime next month (August)
- Biology MS/PhD student. 29 years old. 
- I have a DOG. She is small (a shitzu mutt), adorable, and very friendly. Potty trained. Hoping to find a dog-friendly home where she won't be lonely while I'm working or at class. I'm a huge dog lover in general. 
- I have 10k saved up and will be working in a lab. Also parents can spot me. So I'll never be late with rent. 
- Hoping to pay less than ~800 a month. 
- Need to be near SFU.
- I'm very easy going and never get angry. Since I live far away we can't meet in person, but I suggest you surf through my facebook and see I'm not a weirdo - https://www.facebook.com/aj.keefe.5 
- I lived in Bellingham for 6 years and have had many many roommates (probably about 15-20). So I know the drill. 
- I don't smoke or do drugs. I sometimes drink socially but not too often. 

Please let me know! Hoping to sort this housing situation out ASAP to lessen the stress of moving to a new country

- AJ    "

Hi there, I'm looking for a responsible and considerate roommate (male or female). I have a furnished private spare 1 BR available for a roommate in a lovely home in the Brentwood area located in North Burnaby. I am the owner of the property and also reside on the main level of the home. I am a man, professionally employed with a full time career and I enjoy a quiet lifestyle.  The bedroom and overall living space of the home is suited for a mature (ideally 35 +) considerate person who is professionally employed, or a mature student. A person who prefers to do their socializing outside of the home keeping the home environment to be enjoyed as a tranquil and quiet space to relax and replenish one's mind, body, and spirit at the end of a workday. If your primary residence is out of town but you commute to work in Vancouver and you are seeking rental accommodation part time I am open to negotiating and possibly reducing the rent.

The house is conveniently close to public transit. Downtown Vancouver is only 20 minutes by car but is easily accessible by sky train at Brentwood Town Centre which is 5 minutes walking distance from the house. Shopping and restaurants in the Brentwood & Heights Neighbourhood are right at your doorstep. There are walking and biking trails near by, as well as Confederation Park and the Eileen Daily leisure pool & fitness centre. 

Must be very comfortable around dogs/cats, non-smoker (no smoking of any kind on the premises), no drugs, no pets. You prefer to keep your home environment clean and tidy and others describe you as considerate and responsible. If this sounds like you and you are interested in viewing the bedroom and living space please send me an email and tell me a bit about yourself. LGBQT+ friendly.

The bedroom is available now. If this advertisement is still up it means the room is still available. 
*Damage deposit (half months rent), as well as first and last months rent required up front. 
*References required. 
*Month to Month Rental.

Rent (single occupancy $900.00)
Includes:
-Private furnished 1 BR 
-All Utilities (except cable)
-High speed wifi
-Use of Washer/Dryer 
-Full Bathroom 
-Full Kitchen 
-Living room
-Dining room
-Enclosed sundeck 

You would also have access to:
-Large and Very Private Backyard -two apple trees, cherry tree, raspberry bushes, blueberry bushes 
-Outside Garden (if you are inclined it may be possible for you to have your own vegetable garden)
-Outside Patio (rose garden, fireplace)

Ideally situated room in a two bedroom apartment, available August 1st!

The Burnaby Heights building, on 388 Skeena St, just a block away from the Kootenay bus loop, is an environmentally conscious dream come true!  The building's design is called a Passive Home, which means:

1) The apartment is properly insulated.

2) ZERO air leakages.

3) No 'Thermal Bridges'.  Which is when warmth from indoors is able to pass right through a wall.

4) Triple (3x) pane glass in all the windows!

5) Properly situated building to receive sunlight in the winter, and shade in the summertime!

So the heating bill is 10% of a typical bill - which is pretty nifty.

Also, Washer and Dryer in unit, of course.  Rec-room as part of the building available to book (free!), which features a ping pong table, very nice patio (BYOBBQ), suitable for small to medium sized social gatherings.  No TV in that area, but I have a projector that can be set up virtually anywhere.

Furthermore, the apartment features an HRV system. Which stands for Heat Recovery Ventilation.  This ensures that there is a constant supply of fresh air taken from the outside, without losing any of the heat from the inside! Neat, eh?!

Lastly, our building is affiliated with Modo car share, and you can receive a $100 credit with them if you sign up through the building. There's also talk of being a future site of the modo Bike Share program, down the road!

And there is a $150 move-in credit, which would be taken off your first months rent.  Security deposit of half-a-months rent required.
--------------------------

So that's the building, but what about me, your prospective room-mate?  Axe-murderer? Sorry, you'll just have to keep looking if your trying to snag an axe-murderer as a roomie. Best of luck, but time is a-ticking, so you better get looking quick! Chop chop! (<= Get it? )

Okay, so I think that establishes the fact that I am a seriously funny guy (cough, cough).  In addition to such examples of comedic gold, I'd want you to know that I am a 31 year old man, currently single, who is Vegetarian, leaning towards becoming fully Vegan.  I love to cook, and as everyone who loves to cook knows, it's way better to cook for someone else, than just for yourself.

For that reason, I would be thrilled to have a roommate who is also Vegetarian, but don't take that as a deal-breaker.  And who knows, maybe I can get you to come over from the dark side ;)

I don't drink very often, and I don't drink very much when I do.  There would be no smoking of any substances INSIDE the place. Take that any way you see fit, because there are plenty of idyllic parks nearby.

I am a MAJOR NERD, and love to learn.  I also love to create, in a myriad of different mediums.  I am meeting a major need of mine by keeping my living quarters in harmonious order, so if you are very messy, and comfortable with staying messy, then I wish you the best of luck in finding a place elsewhere.

I  worship science, but I have first hand experience that the Universe winks at us in inexplicable ways, ergo, I am very open to spirituality in all the different forms that it can take.

Shoot me any further questions you might have! I will post indoor pictures as soon as I can, but for now you'll have to visualize it from the floor plan and the building's exterior (sorry, I know that's not ideal!)

Please contact me, either by e-mail or by phone!  show contact info

Hello Hi,
I have a room available at the Pink Palace and am hoping to make some dreams come true by having the first participant in the Synergize Community Health and Business Incubator move in. I’m looking for Changemakers, Healers, and Creatives. Someone who loves community, and community building, and wants to create a source of income doing something they’re passionate about. Yoga, gym, socials, support and accountability in building your business will be yours and so much more if I choo, choo, choose you. (Bonus points if you know what tv show that’s from). The room available is in a 4 bedroom upper level suite In the Metrotown area shared with myself and one other roommate. The fourth room is a shared office space. It is a 7 minute walk to Metropolis mall and 13 minute walk to Metrotown and Patterson Skytrains. There are lots of places to dine out and two gyms in walking distance as well as a co-working space a block away. Please take a peak at www.synergizecommunity.com to see if this is something that aligns with your vision/lifestyle (This is a beta test of the incubator, so the 10% donation is optional. Please read website for details)
A little bit about myself = I've spent the last 2 years transitioning from the ECE (Early Childhood Education) field into wellness. In 2017 I did my Yoga 200hrs at Karma Teachers. Then in 2018 I did a chair massage course as well as a Thai Massage course. I am currently completing a Life Coaching course through Rhodes Wellness college. My life dream is to create a space for individuals to learn how to create sustenance by doing something that brings them joy (most of the time), as well as helping them create a healthy lifestyle. I will be the first person to journey through this incubator and I'm hoping you will join me.
If you are interested please reply with a little bit about yourself and why you think you would be a good fit.
Thanks :)

THE NEIGHBORHOOD:

The Heights is a special place.

The Heights is one of the best-kept secrets in the Lower Mainland. With a strong sense of community and history, beautiful views, parks and trails, recreational amenities, and a thriving business district all within walking distance, on the Heights, life is as it should be.

Famous for its local eateries, the area is walking distance from major grocery stores, schools, parks, a local library, recreation center, and is a stone’s throw from Italian delis, bakeries, and coffee shops.

Local hotspots like Anton’s Pasta Bar, Cioffi’s Meat Market, Valley Bakery, and the Chez Meme Baguette Bistro have all maintained their status as local landmarks, and they are just a handful of the many businesses that carry a witty, small-town charm.

We are just up the hill from Eileen Dailly Park, Pool and Fitness Centre. We are minutes from buses and skytrain. SFU, BCIT, and the PNE are nearby. This area of North Burnaby is truly the perfect hub for all destinations in and around the Lower Mainland.

If you're interested, please EMAIL with your phone number and some DETAILS about yourself and we'll get back to you soon! Thank you for your interest.    "

Hi there!

We are a family (one couple & brother) seeking a suite, preferably in the North Burnaby area. 

We are all mature, working individuals (can provide proof of employment). We are quiet and respectful tenants and can provide excellent previous landlord references!

A little about us:
We enjoy spending time at home watching movies, but also love being outside! You can usually find us at a nearby beach or park and taking night time walks with our dog (he is a 7lb mature dog, extremely quiet & house trained)! 

Why are we looking?
We are currently looking for a larger space, we also would like to see the options for main floor suites as opposed to basement suites. 

Our requirements:
Must have 2 bedroom minimum, be dog friendly, and stay below $1500 budget. 

If you have something that seems like it may work for us please let us know! We’ll be happy to meet with you!!    "

One of our premium retail offerings is the COFFEE BAR which welcome all of our valued clients
and members the very moment they step inside our Ground Level area.

We are looking for a Coffee Operator who’d be a perfect fit to run and manage the Coffee Bar. Strategically located beside the reception area,and facing the inside visitor lot, the Coffee Bar has its own door to receive not just BackBone Clients and Members, but as well as outside customers.

With the right amount of dedicated space, including an extra long table and high-chairs, our Coffee Bar is fully turn-key. All you need to do is set up your coffee machines, supplies, and staff. The Coffee Bar will be built out, and that there is no capital improvements needed to be made (aside from your own equipment which you will bring).

This is an exciting opportunity to run a reputable cafe with a popular food menu and high coffee
turnover.

A small but busy cafe in a prime position in the bubbling Abbotsford area. It has seating for approximately 10 people but can serve about 100 or more, catering to members of BackBone who have coworking desks, office/retail spaces, as well as the lounge passers and walk in clients on the Ground Level.

A relaxing welcoming atmosphere coupled with an emphasis on premium blend coffee, tea, and
food would definitely be a new gem in South Fraser Way. Success for this coffee bar would assure the operator a strong financial turnover and profit.

Don't pass up your chance to take this promising coffee bar space and make it yours!

Looking to put my rooms online for someone looking for a place to crash for a day, a week or a month. 
As I have friends who come to Vancouver for various permitting updates, course upgrades, school, visiting, performances, tourism and much more. I want to open my guest accommodation up to more people who are looking for temporary accommodation. I'm very flexible on negotiations as each inquiry is different.  So please just message me for more information. I have a private room and my couch, crashing on the couch for a few nights is a lot cheaper so depending on what you're coming into the city to do, we can negotiate. While this is a 3 bedroom of which I live in the apartment with occasional renters, I'm only using one of the rooms for hosting occasional visitors,  transient travellers, and couch surfers. I like hosting people and meeting new people. The bathroom is shared so I do like visitors to take care of the place as well as the common areas.    "

Real Estate prices in Cold Lake, Alberta have fallen by as much as 50%.

Take advantage of the downturn in Alberta's and Cold Lake’s slow economy.  Now’s the time to buy when prices are almost half of what they were a few years ago.  Any uptake in the economy would reap good returns on this investment property.  Most of the apartments in the building are owned by out of town owners.  Tenant and property management is already in place, so this would be a turn-key operation.

The property is situated next to a lake and was built in 1984.  It offers 3 bedrooms; 1 bathroom; large living room; and a balcony.

Hi!

My name is Emily and I’m looking for a roommate as of August 1st or 15th.

About the suite/room:
- Located in the Sapperton area of New Westminster, and a 5 minute walk from the skytrain.
- Bright and spacious, about 1000 square feet. It’s a corner unit, so lots of windows and light.
- Room is big, approx. 12’x12’.
- There are two bathrooms, so you will have your own bathroom (except when I need to shower, as there’s only one bath/shower).
- Has a decent sized balcony equipped with a catio.
- Room and apartment are completely furnished, you just need your own linens.
- $775/month includes everything: electric, heating, hot water, cable, internet, Netflix.
- Street parking can be discussed if needed.
- Rent is month-to-month, short or long term is fine.
- Sorry but there is no insuite laundry or a dishwasher, but there is card operated laundry in the building. 
- NOTE: there are two resident kitties. I don’t mind if you have a cat so long as he/she jives with my two. That being said, you have to be okay with kitties and periodic lap snuggles.

About you:
- Must love cats!
- Preferably working and have stable income.
- Doesn’t matter if you smoke so long as you smoke outside.
- Doesn’t matter if you have people over so long as they are respectful. 
- Doesn’t matter if you’re male or female so long as you’re tidy and pay rent on time.

About me:
- Late 20’s female.
- I’m clean, quiet, and don’t have many people over.
- Right now I’m in between contracts, but I work in film so I usually work more than full time and I’m not home often.

Please send me a message with a little bit about yourself if you’re interested, or have any questions. Good luck out there!    "

Also as viewing is not possible, I accept short-term tenants who want to stay for a month. THIS IS NOT SCAM, DON'T WORRY.

I think someone else may have posted this a little while ago, but just thought I'd help give a caution to folks renting or buying around here up from Burn Lake rail. It's horrible, shaking 17-24 hours a day from heavy and idling freight (mainly Coal) trains. It never stops. The acceleration or heavy braking will jolt you from your sleep repeatedly causing a spike in blood pressure and possible cardiac event. It's 4:14 am and they have been braking and idling now for 31.5 hours; no break. My family and I have lived here since the mid eighties. It was nice, peaceful, great trails etc. Now (since 2014) nobody ever sleeps and/or has vibroacoutic illness. Seriously, objects rattle in a home with a well insulated attic. It goes THROUGH earplugs. Your proximity doesn't need be all that close. We don't live very close. Back in 2014-2015, the federal government ruled that they could do pretty much anything they want without upgrading the actual rail to handle it. That's why there are soooo many derailments since then, workers dying etc.  
Good luck.

Maintenance-conscious, employed former residential and commercial multi-property owner, renovator, stager, manager, hotelier, and property investment consultant who transitioned to a literary career seven years ago as a writer of international property books and courses. After five years, I was recruited as an editorial consultant to Fortune500 multinationals by a NYC firm, for which I happily work about 30 hours per week, at home, and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future.

My teen's p-t job is light property maintenance for two eight-unit rental buildings. Since attending SFU in September 2020 is planned, we two are relocating back to BC next summer, and plan to stay for good.

Formerly of Saltspring and, prior, Nelson, we've spent a month back in BC during each of the last two summers, anticipating the move home. Once we establish a rapport, we could travel back to BC to become acquainted with you during, ideally, November or December 2019, and/or March 2020.

Seeking a term of four months to five years, please, in a quiet location, ideally from July 2020. Background check expected.

Please contact me to discuss your needs and potential terms, or to share an idea. (Otherwise, please do pass it on, with thanks.)

All you’ll need is your suitcase (we provide the hangers)!  There will be an additional cost for having the place furnished, but we can discuss that upon meeting.

If you're looking to move in with a pet we’re open to them living there too!  An additional deposit would be required.

For viewings please get in touch with me directly to arrange a time.  If I don't answer please leave a message and I'll get back to you promptly.

Hello

Looking for one individual to share a safe space (LGBTQ friendly, body positive, sex work positive, BIPOC friendly, 420 friendly) with me and my chihuahua mix in a 2 bedroom apt in Burnaby Metrotown, starting August 1 or Sept 1.

Looking for long term, but will consider 6-month lease. Preference goes to 420 friendly, chihuahua friendly peoples. Also friends/peeps of the LGBTQ and BIPOC community, a non-partier-more-get-together type, professional.

A single small-medium sized dog is welcome but would need to be socialized with my dog. Caged animals accepted, must stay in your room. Unfortunately, no large dogs or cats.

About the place, rent for the room (your room) is $1000 (includes hydro and internet). It’s also the bigger room of the two. The suite is furnished and on the 5th floor looking out at the mountains. Comes with dishwasher/dryer and a wrap around balcony. There is downstairs laundry, gym, an outdoor pool and underground parking (additional cost). Quite literally right across the Metrotown and very central to a lot of amenities.

Me: I am a 30-something yr old web designer and I have a part time job on the weekends. Im not a partier and looking for same however I am 420 friendly. I’m a motorcycle enthusiast, Doggo parent, more home body than out doors type. I enjoy kick boxing (12 years), cooking (sometimes...Mostly eat out or microwave/oven bake) and The Big Lebowski is my fave stoner movie. I see home as a place to unwind from a day of 9-5. 

If you have any questions, please DM me.

Hi there!

I am a working professional who is currently looking for a roommate to share either a 2-BR apartment or townhouse together in Burnaby or New West. This would ideally be for September or October onwards. Budget: $800-1000/month. I don't have too much furniture, so I am open to either joining someone who already has a place, or collaborating with someone in a similar position to look for a (furnished) place together.

I am a tidy, but chill individual (I'm ok with some clutter, but nothing dirty/gross). I work the typical Monday to Friday 9am-5pm and am generally out on weekends. During evenings, you can find me doing exciting things like eating, chilling, and watching some Netflix. You would be welcome to join if this is also your thing!

Looking for: a fellow responsible working professional, non-smoker, non-partier, preferably no 420. Open to pets, especially if they're cute :)

Please send me an email if interested.
Thanks!    "

THE NEIGHBORHOOD:

The Heights is a special place.

The Heights is one of the best-kept secrets in the Lower Mainland. With a strong sense of community and history, beautiful views, parks and trails, recreational amenities, and a thriving business district all within walking distance, on the Heights, life is as it should be.

Famous for its local eateries, the area is walking distance from major grocery stores, schools, parks, a local library, recreation center, and is a stone’s throw from Italian delis, bakeries, and coffee shops.

Local hotspots like Anton’s Pasta Bar, Cioffi’s Meat Market, Valley Bakery, and the Chez Meme Baguette Bistro have all maintained their status as local landmarks, and they are just a handful of the many businesses that carry a witty, small-town charm.

We are just up the hill from Eileen Dailly Park, Pool and Fitness Centre. We are minutes from buses and skytrain. SFU, BCIT, and the PNE are nearby. This area of North Burnaby is truly the perfect hub for all destinations in and around the Lower Mainland.

If you're interested, please EMAIL with your phone number and some DETAILS about yourself and we'll get back to you soon! Thank you for your interest.

We have a furnished four bedroom suite with full kitchen, a big sunroom, dining room, living room, two bathrooms and a laundry room ready for an international student. (Home Stay welcome) The whole place is about 2200 sf and each bedroom is about 12 by 12 feet. Each has a bed, desk, closet with drawers and a lamp. It's an amazing house with it's own private entrance from the side yard and a private driveway. The parking on driveway and garage is limited, only 1 more parking is available for the moment, so we are looking for students who use public transportation (there is a bus stop right outside the house on Burris St. that takes you to Metrotown, SFU, Edmund sky train station Douglas college or New West skytrain station, or BCIT and Brentwood mall in the opposite direction )
The reason we are looking for international students is that we don't want any party animals running wild away from parents, but if you are serious about your studies and are Registered students we would be ok with you too, but there is ABSOLUTELY no smoking and drugs allowed in, around or even away from the house.
You must be a respectful, well mannered, and know how to clean after yourself to apply, there is a rotating list of chores like vacuuming, toilet clean up.
We are a couple living in the same place, very quite and exceptionally clean. There’s tenant living in the basement so please keep the noice down always. There is TV with cable and WiFi for your use as well as basic kitchen utensils. Washer and dryer is in the garage.
There is ONE person per room policy and the rent is $650 for each bedroom.
There are currently two rooms available and one is for visiting guest use. Very seldom we have friends or relatives staying overnight. So there’s only 4 person sharing the 2200 sf upper level house (with mountain view) plus a 3500 sf landscaped backyard for you to enjoy.  available from August 1st.

Description for **OPEN HOUSE** 842 Mariner Way, Parksville

OPEN HOUSE SAT July 14 Sun 2-4pm

Located just off Resort Drive, and adjacent to the Five (5) Star Tigh Na Mara Beach Club. Rathtrevor beach is Canada's only true superbeach. After the tide goes out and the sand bakes in the sun all day, the water is blue green almost tropical warm temperature. This fantastic home is located in desirable San Pariel, which literally means without (sans) parallel, or without equal. This home is adjacent to the Englishman River Estuary. This is the nicest neighbourhood on planet earth. Tofino has nothing on this place. Enjoy your morning coffee on the front porch. This oceanside property is peaceful. The sunrise over the islets is positively spiritual. It is merely one hundred (100) steps to the beach. The home is located on millionaire's Row, and is surrounded by multi-million dollar dream homes. It is a fantastic investment. It has two kitchens, boasts two driveways and is great for rental/recreation/retirement. Imagine playing chess and building lifelong memories with the kids in your amazing sun room.

To whom it may concern:
My name is Joshua,
I am 32 years old.
The company I work for has offered to help facilitate my transition into the Vancouver area by covering my first month's rent and damage deposit upfront on my behalf. This is not just a promotion but more so a chance for me to finally live much closer to my daughter.
My needs are simple, I require in suite w/d and an affordable monthly rate preferably at or below $800/m.
I provide my own internet services. It is imperative that I keep my expenses as small as possible in order to allow for the maximum possible amount of growth for the future.
I am looking to be situated in Vancouver by August 15th at the very latest and August 1st at the earliest.
I am a single  working professional and do not party.
I also do not own any pets.
If you happen to require a high quality tenant with amazing references and a guaranteed income, please contact me as soon as possible.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.    "

Looking for working people/ students. Rent is 600$ everything included. Bc hydro, fortis, internet. Looking for someone responsible and respectful. The house is shared by 4 people normally. We are all working full time and are fairly social with one another, though some of us are more reclusive than others. Ideal person would be a full time worker, or a full time student. We try to keep the house in good order despite the inevitable diffusion of responsibility that arises from a house of bachelors. We are pretty open and non judgemental. Things like theft, extreme noise and late night antics are not acceptable however, obviously. 

On the back of the house is a big deck with a nice view of Burnaby mountain. Large back yard as well. 

No pets 

Please tell me about yourself if you are interested.

Hello Hi,
I have a room available at the Pink Palace and am hoping to make some dreams come true by having the first participant in the Synergize Community Health and Business Incubator move in.  I’m looking for Changemakers, Healers, and Creatives.  Someone who loves community, and community building, and wants to create a source of income doing something they’re passionate about.  Yoga, gym, socials, support and accountability in building your business will be yours and so much more if I choo, choo, choose you.  (Bonus points if you know what tv show that’s from).  The room available is in a 4 bedroom upper level suite In the Metrotown area shared with myself and one other roommate.  The fourth room is a shared office space.  It is a  7 minute walk to Metropolis mall and 13 minute walk to Metrotown and Patterson Skytrains. There are lots of places to dine out and two gyms in walking distance as well as a co-working space a block away. Please take a peak at www.synergizecommunity.com to see if this is something that aligns with your vision/lifestyle (This is a beta test of the incubator, so the 10% donation is optional.  Please read website for details)
A little bit about myself = I've spent the last 2 years transitioning from the ECE (Early Childhood Education) field into wellness.  In 2017 I did my Yoga 200hrs at Karma Teachers.  Then in 2018 I did a chair massage course as well as a Thai Massage course.  I am currently completing a Life Coaching course through Rhodes Wellness college.  My life dream is to create a space for individuals to learn how to create sustenance by doing something that brings them joy (most of the time), as well as helping them create a healthy lifestyle.  I will be the first person to journey through this incubator and I'm hoping you will join me.
If you are interested please reply with a little bit about yourself and why you think you would be a good fit.
Thanks :)

Hello, this cozy 1 bedroom + den condo is becoming available on July 13th, as my current tenant is relocating for job purposes. Move-in dates of July 22, 29, and August 1st are also possible.

I am looking for a professional person, couple, or mature students who are able to provide me with solid references.

The unit has the following amenities: in-suite laundry, gas fireplace (recently maintained), microwave, dishwasher and portable a/c unit. 6 months to 1 year lease preferred. Internet and Pik TV are available and payable by the tenant; account type is negotiable. Hydro is also extra, but very reasonably priced and usually comes to no more than around $24 per month.

The renovations done to this FULLY FURNISHED Greater Vancouver  area home were inspired by the owner’s many vacations in the beautiful West Coast styled properties of Whistler BC. This older home has been warmly renovated with real hardwood floors and cabinets and beautiful fir beams and french doors.  Fully framed glass doors open to amazing outdoor deck space looking over the Burrard inlet and Belcarra park. The home boasts fantastic  views  of Mount Baker,  sweeping across for 270 degrees site lines.  When you wake up in the expansive master bedroom you feel like you are living outdoors with the ocean and mountains sprawling out in front of you, while you sip your morning coffee made at the in-room coffee bar. 

This Burnaby home has four bedrooms, two bathrooms and full kitchen, dining and living room over two floors. The owner will keep the private basement suite for personal use on an alternating week basis. The front driveway and shed will be available for tenant’s storage needs and the owner will keep the garage out back. 

The home is walking distance to the Hastings Express B Line meaning you can get downtown or up to SFU faster than driving. 25 mins downtown or 10 mins to SFU. A short five min walk to bus.

The home has immaculately cared for gardens and flower pots, and a ping pong table and a trampoline, making outdoor living even more enjoyable. The gardens and pots have a fully automatic sprinkler system and the owner will continue the outdoor maintenance during the tenure of this home.    "

Room available in the basement suite of a large house in Burnaby, less than 2 miles from SFU campus. 

Currently there are three people living in the basement suite. My roommate is moving out at the end of July, leaving the room that is shown in the pictures open (it will be cleaned prior to your move in date). I will be moving out on August 14th, which means that you (the new roommate!) will ultimately be sharing the space only with other roommate (male in late 20's). There is a wonderful beagle named Duke that frequents the basement suite, so DOG LOVERS PREFERRED. 

The rent is $600.00 per month for the small room or $700.00 for the big room, with a $300.00 refundable security deposit. The lease is month to month.

Both single occupancy and couples are allowed, although the price will go up with couples according to our landlord’s request (ask about this option if you are interested). We live in a beautiful and safe neighborhood with lots of dogs and parks nearby. Right across the street is a nice trail to go for walks or runs on. You are only a 10-15 minute walk away from Greystone Plaza with Hop & Vine, SuperValue, Liquor store, Vet, Dentist, and Shoppers. You will be right on the 136 bus line, which is about a 30 minute bus ride to Simon Fraser university, or a 45 minute walk along nature trails. The house is conveniently located to a skytrain station. It is a 15 minute walk to Lake City Way skytrain station. Going downtown from the house is about 40 minutes. 

If you drive, there is plenty of parking on the street. 

There is a living room, kitchen (with stove, fridge, oven and dishwasher), and one full bathroom. 

The rent includes:
- Utilities (hydro and heat)
- Washer and dryer
- Hi-speed internet (WiFi)

I am looking for a female (preferably) to rent a room in a three bedroom apartment. The apartment is a 10 minute bus ride, or a 5 minute drive to Simon Fraser University. We are also located 15 minutes walking distance from Kensington Shopping plaza, which has a safeway, liquor store, shoppers drugs mart, and various restaurants. If you transit, there are several buses that you can catch with in short walking distance and include: the 95B line, 144 metrotown stn/ SFU and the 160 Poco/ Kootney loop. 

About us: Currently this apartment has two females in our late 20s and early 30s. I am currently a Student at SFU, studying Criminology, and are both employed full time. We are super out going and friendly individuals and are looking for someone who is equally outgoing and isn't going to hide out in their room all the time. That said obviously personal space is important and we are very respectful of that. 

Unfortunately this is not a party house and we are not looking for couples. You are free to have people over, but you need to be respectful of the fact that we often have to be up early for school/ work and I often study at home. That said we do have drinks together and friends over, so we're not as strict as we sound. If you're looking for a place to party every night, this is definitely not the place for you. 

I already have a cat, and unfortunately she doesn't get along with other cats very well. Because of this there can be no other pets. She is a lovely cat though and everyone seems to love her, so hopefully you will too. 

The apartment is fully furnished and internet and hydro are included in the rental amount which is $430.00 a month. 

There are coin operated washers and dryers on site. Street Parking is available for free and parking in the lot is $30 a month, I believe. I’ll have to double check that.

Hi there.   My name is Michael and I am a full-time professional looking for a lovely home in a difficult housing city.  All of my fingers and toes are crossed! :)   What you will notice about me is that I am friendly, but also very respectful of space.  I enjoy my quiet time as well as engaging in shared conversation, as I value communication.  I do not party, or smoke or do recreational drugs.  I come without pets, but I do have a few plants and some loved ukuleles (all well-cared for).  I clean up after myself and my surroundings without prompting, because my parents raised me to be a polite and courteous human.  My rent is paid on time always by post-dated cheques.  I am looking for something unfurnished as I already have a comfortable bed I could never part with.  My preference would be anywhere close to a Skytrain (East Van, Burnaby, New West).  
I live a compassionate, encouraging and caring life.  I hope to find a new home, where that could benefit the household.  To be a new friend rather than just a tenant.  Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have.  Thank you for taking the time to read this! :))    "

hi everyone! We are looking for a 4 bedroom in the tri cities or Pitt - Maple area. Prefer PoCo as my daughter wants to stay at Pine Tree and son is at Maple Creek . Three bedrooms up and one down or a separate unit with own kitchen in basement would be perfect but not necessary. Its for myself and my fiancé and two teenagers (girl 14 and boy 13) and my 83 year old mother. Looking for August or September move in. We have one dog and one cat, both super clean and quiet. Dog never barks and he's a tiny pomeranian mix. We need to move as my fiancé just got full custody of his son and we are in a two bedroom now. My mom is getting older and will need someone close by soon so may as well do it now.  Budget is $3000. Text me if you have something. No phone calls please and no time for scams

Hello,

My name is Dalton, I am 25 years old and Im a working professional who currently lives in Ontario. My work is openning up a new location at Brentwood Mall in Burnaby, British Colombia. I am seeking a home for myself and my 7 year old dog, Scooby Doo, for August 1st.

I work full time, I am very respectful and have always been a great tenant since the age of 16, when I got my first apartment on my own. I would prefer a 1 bedroom apartment with utilities included for around $1000-1200 a month, but am also open to shared accommodations with a roommate.

August is coming fast, I know nobody out in British Columbia, so I am in desperate need of finding somewhere to live. Please dont hesitate to send me a message. Ill greatly appreciate all inquiries.

One private bedroom available for rent in a two bedroom apartment.

My current roommate just moved out so I’m looking for a new one.
I would prefer a clean female around my age. 
Just don’t feel like cleaning up all the time after some lazy ass guy, been there done that.. too many times 

Laminate floors and paint (the ugly eggshell) were done in December 2017, except for the bathroom which I will get done soon in my own expense since the landlord isn’t interested in doing that.

I’m 34, one of those creepy truck drivers, working nights and usually gone for the most of the days.

Highgate area, 750$ with utilities included.
Decent size tv, Netflix, bbq..
Laundry room is next door in the building, some storage space and a parking space in the garage available.
Rent discount possible after the first month for the right person - if you don’t leave a mess all over the place and don’t eat all my food :P

Closest sky train is the Edmonds station, about 10 min walk.
There's 3 Walmarts but all in about 10-15 min driving or you can use the sky train to the one in Metrotown.
The closest grocery store is save on foods at the Highgate mall and it's in about 5 min walking distance.
There's also a gym, Starbucks, autoplan, a donair shop, hairdressers and some other shops in the same mall.
Ground floor, should be available from start of June. 

No drugs, no chain smokers and no pets.
Except fishes. Fishes are cool..

Short term also possible. 

Thanks!
